   ViiV Healthcare is a global specialty HIV company, the only one that is 100% focused on researching and delivering new medicines for people living with, and at risk of, HIV. ViiV is highly mission-driven in our unrelenting commitment to being a trusted partner for all people living with and affected by HIV. Our aim is to think, act, and connect differently through a focus on education on and treatment for HIV.  We go to extraordinary lengths to deliver the sorts of breakthroughs, both in treatments, care solutions and communities, that really count. We go beyond the boundaries of medicine by taking a holistic approach to HIV through developing and supporting sustainable community programs and improving access to care.  We are fully committed to push through every challenge until HIV/AIDS is eradicated. ViiV has played a significant part in delivering breakthroughs that have turned HIV into a manageable health condition. We offer the largest portfolio of HIV medicines available anywhere, and we continue our work to cater for the widest possible range of needs in response to the HIV epidemic.

  <p>
   We are aware of how much is at stake for those affected by HIV and we show up every day 100% committed to the patients. Our work culture is fast-paced, diverse, inclusive, competitive, and caring. But ViiV isn’t just somewhere to work – it’s a place to belong, an invitation to bring your very best, and a team full of impact-driven team members who are hungry to make a difference. While we have been improving lives of HIV patients for 30 years, this is an especially exciting time to be at ViiV, as we evaluate novel approaches to treatment and prevention that could further reduce the impact of HIV on individuals and communities.

   ViiV Healthcare was created as a joint venture by Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline in November 2009 with both companies transferring their HIV assets to the new company. In 2012 Shionogi joined the company. 76.5% of the company is now owned by GlaxoSmithKline, 13.5% by Pfizer and 10% by Shionogi.

   For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The retail pharmacy setting has become a key access point for consumers and is the preferred vaccination site for many adults. Retail pharmacies are found in large, national drug chains, regional grocery outlets, mass-merchants and in independently owned stores. Within the top chains, there are approximately 36,000 outlets. Based on their location within communities, retail pharmacies have become important access points for adults seeking immunization.

   For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.

   For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   GSK’s US vaccines business is organized into local ecosystem teams, designed to support the unique needs of the customer base in the given geography. In a local ecosystem commercial model, there are multiple customer-facing roles, each with unique customers/call points, but all dependent upon a high degree of collaboration.

   For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   GSK’s US vaccines business is organized into local ecosystem teams, designed to support the unique needs of the customer base in the given geography. In a local ecosystem commercial model, there are multiple customer-facing roles, each with unique customers/call points, but all dependent upon a high degree of collaboration.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <b>

The role of the VAE is to engage C/D level clinical &amp; non-clinical stakeholders within larger provider organizations to understand unique customer needs/priorities and to deliver a customized value proposition. The VAE should possess strong customer engagement skills, experience with healthcare contracting, knowledge of the target customer organization and decision-making process.

  <p>
   For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   GSK’s US vaccines business is organized into local ecosystem teams, designed to support the unique needs of the customer base in the given geography. In a local ecosystem commercial model, there are multiple customer-facing roles, each with unique customers/call points, but all dependent upon a high degree of collaboration.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <b>
    Vaccines Account Executive, or VAE
   </b>
   , is pivotal in most ecosystems, owning the B2B customer relationship in mid to large-sized group provider accounts, including large primary care provider groups, multi-disciplinary medical groups, independent hospitals, and public health providers (FQHC’s, local health departments, etc.). The role of the VAE is to engage C/D level clinical &amp; non-clinical stakeholders within larger provider organizations to understand unique customer needs/priorities and to deliver a customized value proposition. The VAE should possess strong customer engagement skills, experience with healthcare contracting, knowledge of the target customer organization and decision-making process.

   For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   GSK’s US vaccines business is organized into local ecosystem teams, designed to support the unique needs of the customer base in the given geography. In a local ecosystem commercial model, there are multiple customer-facing roles, each with unique customers/call points, but all dependent upon a high degree of collaboration.

   For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   GSK’s US vaccines business is organized into local ecosystem teams, designed to support the unique needs of the customer base in the given geography. In a local ecosystem commercial model, there are multiple customer-facing roles, each with unique customers/call points, but all dependent upon a high degree of collaboration. The Vaccine Ecosystem Lead (VEL) will oversee the local team, fully accountable for the commercial performance, management of team and development of individuals.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The role of the VEL will be to lead day to day execution of the vaccine business unit’s strategic priorities, helping to customize that execution to the needs of the local ecosystem. The VEL will be responsible maximizing the business opportunities within their ecosystem through local business knowledge, strong decision making, effective resource allocation and exceptional people leadership. The VEL reports to the Area Field Vice President (FVP) and will be a member of the Area sales leadership team.

   For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.
  </p>
  <p>
   GSK’s US vaccines business is organized into local ecosystem teams, designed to support the unique needs of the customer base in the given geography. In a local ecosystem commercial model, there are multiple customer-facing roles, each with unique customers/call points, but all dependent upon a high
  </p>
  <p>
   degree of collaboration.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <b>
    <span>
     Immunization Specialist, or IS
    </span>
   </b>
   , is pivotal in most ecosystems, responsible for engaging health care providers (HCPs) to drive uptake of GSK vaccines. The role of the Immunization Specialist is to educate HCPs on both disease state and the approved GSK vaccine solutions. The IS must possess strong customer engagement skills, knowledge of GSK vaccines and competitor vaccines, to be able to present a GSK vaccines product and portfolio value proposition. The IS must also collaborate closely within the ecosystem team, including the vaccine ecosystem lead (VEL), vaccine key account lead (VKAL), the vaccine account executive (VAE), and the retail account executive (RAE) roles.

   ViiV Healthcare is a global specialty HIV company, the only one that is 100% focused on researching and delivering new medicines for people living with, and at risk of, HIV. ViiV is highly mission-driven in our unrelenting commitment to being a trusted partner for all people living with and affected by HIV. Our aim is to think, act, and connect differently through a focus on education on and treatment for HIV.  We go to extraordinary lengths to deliver the sorts of breakthroughs, both in treatments, care solutions and communities, that really count. We go beyond the boundaries of medicine by taking a holistic approach to HIV through developing and supporting sustainable community programs and improving access to care.  We are fully committed to push through every challenge until HIV/AIDS is eradicated.

       While we have been improving lives of HIV patients for 30 years, this is an especially exciting time to be at ViiV, as we evaluate novel approaches to treatment and prevention that could further reduce the impact of HIV on individuals and communities.

       ViiV Healthcare was created as a joint venture by Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline in November 2009 with both companies transferring their HIV assets to the new company. In 2012 Shionogi joined the company. 76.5% of the company is now owned by GlaxoSmithKline, 13.5% by Pfizer and 10% by Shionogi.

   For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   GSK’s US vaccines business is organized into local ecosystem teams, designed to support the unique needs of the customer base in the given geography. In a local ecosystem commercial model, there are multiple customer-facing roles, each with unique customers/call points, but all dependent upon a high
  </p>
  <p>
   degree of collaboration.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <b>
    Immunization Specialist, or IS
   </b>
   , is pivotal in most ecosystems, responsible for engaging health care providers (HCPs) to drive uptake of GSK vaccines. The role of the Immunization Specialist is to educate HCPs on both disease state and the approved GSK vaccine solutions. The IS must possess strong customer engagement skills, knowledge of GSK vaccines and competitor vaccines, to be able to present a GSK vaccines product and portfolio value proposition. The IS must also collaborate closely within the ecosystem team, including the vaccine ecosystem lead (VEL), vaccine key account lead (VKAL), the vaccine account executive (VAE), and the retail account executive (RAE) roles.

    The GSK vaccines business is one of the largest in the world, providing more than 30 pediatric, adolescent, adult, and travel vaccines worldwide. GSK’s vaccine heritage spans more than 100 years, beginning in 1882 with the manufacturing of smallpox vaccine. Vaccination is the most effective health intervention after clean water, preventing millions of deaths from infectious disease around the world every year. In the US, vaccination rates remain low among adults for vaccine-preventable diseases. Our ambition is to be a trusted partner in increasing immunization rates and protecting against vaccine-preventable diseases

   For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   GSK’s US vaccines business is organized into local ecosystem teams, designed to support the unique needs of the customer base in the given geography. In a local ecosystem commercial model, there are multiple customer-facing roles, each with unique customers/call points, but all dependent upon a high
  </p>
  <p>
   degree of collaboration.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <b>
    Immunization Specialist, or IS
   </b>
   , is pivotal in most ecosystems, responsible for engaging health care providers (HCPs) to drive uptake of GSK vaccines. The role of the Immunization Specialist is to educate HCPs on both disease state and the approved GSK vaccine solutions. The IS must possess strong customer engagement skills, knowledge of GSK vaccines and competitor vaccines, to be able to present a GSK vaccines product and portfolio value proposition. The IS must also collaborate closely within the ecosystem team, including the vaccine ecosystem lead (VEL), vaccine key account lead (VKAL), the vaccine account executive (VAE), and the retail account executive (RAE) roles.

     For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.

   For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   GSK’s US vaccines business is organized into local ecosystem teams, designed to support the unique needs of the customer base in the given geography. In a local ecosystem commercial model, there are multiple customer-facing roles, each with unique customers/call points, but all dependent upon a high
  </p>
  <p>
   degree of collaboration.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <b>
    Immunization Specialist, or IS
   </b>
   , is pivotal in most ecosystems, responsible for engaging health care providers (HCPs) to drive uptake of GSK vaccines. The role of the Immunization Specialist is to educate HCPs on both disease state and the approved GSK vaccine solutions. The IS must possess strong customer engagement skills, knowledge of GSK vaccines and competitor vaccines, to be able to present a GSK vaccines product and portfolio value proposition. The IS must also collaborate closely within the ecosystem team, including the vaccine ecosystem lead (VEL), vaccine key account lead (VKAL), the vaccine account executive (VAE), and the retail account executive (RAE) roles.

   For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.

   GSK’s US vaccines business is organized into local ecosystem teams, designed to support the unique needs of the customer base in the given geography.

   , is pivotal in most ecosystems, responsible for engaging health care providers (HCPs) to drive uptake of GSK vaccines. The role of the Immunization Specialist is to educate HCPs on both disease state and the approved GSK vaccine solutions.

The IS must also collaborate closely within the ecosystem team, including the vaccine ecosystem lead (VEL), vaccine key account lead (VKAL), the vaccine account executive (VAE), and the retail account executive (RAE) roles.

   For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   GSK’s US vaccines business is organized into local ecosystem teams, designed to support the unique needs of the customer base in the given geography. In a local ecosystem commercial model, there are multiple customer-facing roles, each with unique customers/call points, but all dependent upon a high

   degree of collaboration.

   , is pivotal in most ecosystems, responsible for engaging health care providers (HCPs) to drive uptake of GSK vaccines. The role of the Immunization Specialist is to educate HCPs on both disease state and the approved GSK vaccine solutions. The IS must possess strong customer engagement skills, knowledge of GSK vaccines and competitor vaccines, to be able to present a GSK vaccines product and portfolio value proposition. The IS must also collaborate closely within the ecosystem team, including the vaccine ecosystem lead (VEL), vaccine key account lead (VKAL), the vaccine account executive (VAE), and the retail account executive (RAE) roles.

   For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.

   For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.

   For more than 140 years, GSK has pioneered novel research methods and technologies to help protect people from infectious diseases. Our vaccines portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is the broadest in the industry, helping to protect people throughout their lives. We believe prevention, at scale and for impact, is the best health investment for society, patients, and the economy. Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant burden on society and healthcare systems; approximately $1 trillion in productivity is lost each year due to preventable conditions. This includes the impact from the 330,000 older adults hospitalized globally each year with RSV, the approximately 1 in 3 people who will develop shingles in their lifetime and the 3-11% of people infected with seasonal influenza each year. Our Vaccines portfolio will reach over 1 billion people globally this decade. Each year, around 40% of children globally receive a GSK vaccine and GSK is well-placed to lead in the growing adult immunization market.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   GSK’s US vaccines business is organized into local ecosystem teams, designed to support the unique needs of the customer base in the given geography. In a local ecosystem commercial model, there are multiple customer-facing roles, each with unique customers/call points, but all dependent upon a high
  </p>
  <p>
   degree of collaboration.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <b>
    Immunization Specialist, or IS
   </b>
   , is pivotal in most ecosystems, responsible for engaging health care providers (HCPs) to drive uptake of GSK vaccines. The role of the Immunization Specialist is to educate HCPs on both disease state and the approved GSK vaccine solutions. The IS must possess strong customer engagement skills, knowledge of GSK vaccines and competitor vaccines, to be able to present a GSK vaccines product and portfolio value proposition. The IS must also collaborate closely within the ecosystem team, including the vaccine ecosystem lead (VEL), vaccine key account lead (VKAL), the vaccine account executive (VAE), and the retail account executive (RAE) roles.

   GSK is a global biopharma company with a special purpose – to unite science, technology and talent to get ahead of disease together – so we can positively impact the health of billions of people and deliver stronger, more sustainable shareholder returns – as an organisation where people can thrive.

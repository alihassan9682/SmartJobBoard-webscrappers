 <br/>
 The Military DoD SkillBridge program is an opportunity for Service members to gain valuable civilian work experience through specific industry training, apprenticeships, or internships during the last 180 days of service. SkillBridge connects Service members with industry partners in real-world job experiences under Dept. of Defense Instruction 1322.29. Separating Service members can be granted up to 180 days of permissive duty to focus solely on training full-time with approved industry partners after unit commander (first O-4/Field Grade commander in chain of command) provides written authorization and approval. GE HealthCare as a Skill Bridge partner offers real-world training and work experience in in-demand fields of work while having the opportunity to evaluate the Service member’s suitability for the work. Military DoD SkillBridge participants are not eligible for compensation from GE HealthCare, as they continue to receive military compensation and benefits as active-duty service members.

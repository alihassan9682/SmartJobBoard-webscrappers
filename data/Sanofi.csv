    Overview:
   </b>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Attorney with 5+ years of relevant experience to join the Sanofi Legal Department as Corporate Counsel, responsible for providing legal advice and counsel to internal colleagues in Sanofi’s U.S. Vaccines business unit. This is a broad business lawyering role that involves strategic and transactional counseling.  The Corporate Counsel will provide input on complex and sensitive legal and business issues and will advise internal colleagues in a manner that advances the company’s strategic goals while addressing legal and regulatory risks and preserving and protecting the company’s integrity and reputation. The Corporate Counsel will be expected to provide prompt, strategic, useful, and thorough input to internal colleagues and senior management regarding complex and wide-ranging legal matters, particularly in the areas of advertising and promotion, fraud and abuse, and other applicable healthcare laws.

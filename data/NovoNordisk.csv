        ensure obesity is widely recognized as a chronic disease and to
        reduce barriers to treatment. Our team is the company’s obesity
        strategy anchor, partnering enterprise-wide to deliver on this
        aspiration. The team is comprised of both our home office
        strategy and marketing execution teams and our field based teams
        focusing on customer engagements and execution of our
        strategy. As one of the Novo Nordisk must win battles,
        developing the obesity market is a rare opportunity backed by
        Novo Nordisk's long term commitment and track record in helping
        people living with chronic disease achieve greater health
        outcomes. If you are passionate about being a force for change,

        looking to join a highly diverse and collaborative team, we
        encourage you to apply. Are you ready?

        strategy anchor, partnering enterprise-wide to deliver on this

 </p>
 <p>
  Let’s do this. Let’s change the world. A postdoctoral position is available to investigate the signaling mechanisms governing feeding behavior and energy metabolism at our global headquarters and research site in Thousand Oaks, California. This unique opportunity entails co-mentorship by Dr. Junichiro Sonoda, Ph.D. (Primary PI: Scientific Associate Director, Cardiometabolic Disorders) and Dr. Ki Jeong Lee, Ph.D. (Co-PI: Scientific Associate Director, Discovery Biology). In this vital role, you will be a part of the broader R&amp;D Postdoc Program that focuses on training the next generation of industry scientists. An overwhelming majority of our postdocs go on to advance their careers in industry at leading pharma and biotech companies, including many at Amgen.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <h2>
  Responsibilities:
 </h2>
 <p>
  You will primarily be investigating a novel GPCR-based signaling mechanism that regulates feeding behavior and energy metabolism. The strategic approach involves a combination of multi-omics, proximity labeling, affinity purification, and complementary in vitro and in vivo mechanistic methodologies. Conditional in vivo gene knockout and AAV-mediated gene transduction approaches will also be employed. This comprehensive strategy aims to elucidate the detailed mechanisms of intracellular signal integration through the GPCR in the central nervous system, unveiling novel regulators and mechanisms that control body weight gain.
 </p>
 <p>
  We are looking for a highly talented, self-motivated individual passionate about science and making groundbreaking discoveries. This role offers a dynamic platform for an ambitious individual to make meaningful advancements in the understanding of feeding control mechanisms, leveraging Amgen's state-of-the-art technologies within a supportive and stimulating environment that fosters professional growth. The position is for 3 years, with the option to extend for an additional year.

Our shared mission—to serve patients—has driven our status as one of the world’s preeminent biotechnology companies, reaching over 10 million patients worldwide.

   What you will do
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Let’s do this. Let’s change the world. In this vital role you will be reporting to the Vice President, Global Value &amp; Access and will lead the Inflammation therapeutic area within the Integrated Access Strategy function. This team is responsible for strategic planning to support value and access for all Amgen molecules in development, beginning in Phase I and extending throughout commercialization though to launch and lifecycle management across the Amgen portfolio. Additionally, the team is responsible for global strategic pricing, including recommendations for global price bands and launch sequence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each Integrated Access Strategy incorporates coverage and reimbursement, pricing, value evidence, and policy into the development of a strategic plan that supports the overarching commercial objectives and links to the clinical attributes of the molecule. This plan elucidates and communicates the strategies and tactics to secure and maintain access throughout the lifecycle of a specific molecule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Executive Director will lead a team of Access Strategy Leads who represent payer needs on the multi-disciplinary Product Team for one or more molecules. This will include the development of new plans as well as the update of prior plans to reflect changes in product data and/or the global payer environment. The Executive Director will also represent Global Value &amp; Access on cross functional Therapeutic Area Governance (TAG) and be responsible for ensuring pricing and access considerations are embedded into the therapeutic area strategies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each member of the therapeutic area team led by the Executive Director must work collaboratively across functions to ensure a comprehensive view of his/her assigned products and create and maintain strong collaborative working relationships with key stakeholders. These stakeholders include colleagues in Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Operational Pricing, Advocacy, Health Policy, and Government Affairs and their respective Therapeutic Area heads for those functions represented on TAG (Research, Development, Regulatory, Medical, Operations, Marketing, and Project Management). The individual must also oversee and conduct relevant payer/pricing research and integrate clinical, market, and payer information to develop and communicate the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to product-specific responsibilities, each member of the team also participates in one or more cross-portfolio projects each year. These projects either serve to advance the team’s knowledge of and readiness for the global payer environment, support specific market or product assessments, or attempt to influence payer policy development. Examples include Payer assessments to support potential mergers/acquisitions, payer landscape in emerging markets, exploration of new payer trends (e.g., bundling), or development of a policy white paper to shape external price and reimbursement policies in the global arena.

   What you will do

 </p>
 <p>
  Let’s do this. Let’s change the world!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the context of a rapidly evolving payer environment, Amgen’s increasing emphasis on geographic expansion and companion diagnostics, and a commitment to demonstrate product value, Amgen requires an increasingly sophisticated reimbursement and pricing capability to support market access strategies (an important source for competitive advantage). The Global Integrated Access Strategy team, within the Global Value Access (GVA) function, is a team committed to excellence in this capability in order to position Amgen for continued success. This global team is responsible for strategic planning of value and access for all Amgen molecules in development, beginning in Phase I-II and extending throughout commercialization across the Amgen portfolio. This work also includes lifecycle planning and access support for our in-the-market products. Additionally, the team is responsible for global strategic pricing, including recommendations for global price bands and launch sequence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each Access Plan integrates coverage and reimbursement, pricing, value evidence, advocacy and policy into the development of a strategic plan that supports the overarching commercial position and links to the clinical attributes of the molecule. This plan elucidates and communicates the global strategies and tactics to secure and maintain access throughout the lifecycle of a specific molecule.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this vital role the Director will serve as the Access Strategy Lead (ASL), Maridebart cafraglutide (AMG 133) and will represent payers’ information needs on the multi-disciplinary Product Teams (PT) working on this compound in the obesity franchise. You will also lead and coordinate the cross-functional efforts within Global Value Access (GVA) in order to support the access planning process, including the situation analysis, creation of access strategies, identification of critical success factors, development of pricing guidance and maintenance of price policy. This opportunity will involve interaction with top 10 markets and sub-regions to lead access launch readiness (therapies and companion diagnostics) and execution of the global access strategy on a fast-moving launch timeframe. The individual will be responsible for pricing and access assumptions in global revenue forecasts for select products. The Director must also oversee and conduct relevant payer/pricing market research and Value Evidence Generation (with HEOR) and integrate clinical, market and payer information to develop and communicate the access plan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each Director will work collaboratively across functions to ensure a comprehensive view of their assigned products and create and maintain strong working relationships with key partners. These partners include global colleagues in marketing, development, HEOR, regulatory, operations, advocacy, and government affairs as well as key markets and regional VA colleagues within the US, Europe, Intercontinental and Japan/Asia-Pacific/Australia.
 </p>

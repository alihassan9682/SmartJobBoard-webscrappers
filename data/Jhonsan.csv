The company established its leadership in electrophysiology with the development of the first real-time, 3D cardiac mapping and navigation technology, as well as the first electrophysiology catheter.

 </p>
 <p>
  Janssen Biotech, Inc. is partnering with Legend Biotech USA Inc. to co-develop, manufacture, and commercialize CARVYKTI®, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for Multiple Myeloma. This new treatment paradigm for CAR-T Therapy requires specific skills and creates new resource needs for both the sites and Janssen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Job Description
 </p>
 <p>
  At Janssen Oncology, we are raising the bar on customer experience in the pharmaceutical industry. Our account management teams support the certified sites who care for cancer patients. We are deeply committed to providing them with an exceptional customer experience, so they, in turn, are better positioned to treat the individuals in their care.
 </p>
 <p>
  The CAR-T Cell Therapy Experience Lead is a member of this account management team, reporting to the Senior Manager, CAR-T Cell Therapy Experience Lead. The role will serve as the primary field-based point of contact for a portfolio of certified sites, facilitating successful CARVYKTI® product utilization of the sites by advising them on order management, operations and logistics. In this capacity, you’ll be the face of Janssen Oncology CAR-T utilization to these sites, and will be tasked with upholding the high standards of service to which we subscribe.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Day In The Life
 </p>
 <p>
  For many treatment facilities, CAR-T is a relatively new type of cancer therapy. Your primary responsibility will be to serve as a trusted advisor to the CAR-T Coordinators at these facilities, some of whom may have experience with CAR-T, while others will not. You’ll guide certified sites through the onboarding process, providing process/system training, and serving as their expert resource. Once the certified site is onboarded, you’ll help advance their success with the CARVYKTI® therapy, by supporting day to day logistics and issue resolution related to processes, policies and protocols that support CARVYKTI® order fulfillment and by advising them on opportunities to enhance their operational effectiveness and efficiency. You’ll work closely with the CARVYKTI® Order Specialist Team who will be the certified sites’ primary day-to-day contact for case-level order management. While you’ll occasionally assist with advanced case-level matters, your principal focus will be on site-level CARVYKTI® process optimization.
 </p>
 <p>
  Detailed responsibilities include (but are not limited to):
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Successful site management. Identification and outreach to potential future certified Carvykti treatment centers. Work with a sense of urgency to bring future treatment centers online and to steady state status. Serve as a lateral leader with multiple teams for operational account management, addressing site-specific issues and pursuing improvement opportunities for CARVYKTI® order management/logistics.
  </li>
  <li>
   Expert guidance. Serve as your assigned sites’ subject matter expert for CAR-T operations and logistics, providing counsel on topics ranging from CARVKTI® technology utilization to process optimization.
  </li>
  <li>
   Lead Issue Resolution Process: Serve as central point of contact for issue resolution and customer concern activities with certified treatment centers and cross functional teams.
  </li>
  <li>
   Cross-functional collaboration. Applying a patient centric approach, effectively align cross functional partners through regular participation in matrix calls with alliance partner stakeholders to bring the best possible outcomes for patients and customers. These cross-functional partners include demand generating teams, institutional business partners, field reimbursement colleagues, clinical nurse educators and more.
  </li>
  <li>
   Site education. Facilitate educational engagements aimed ongoing improving CAR-T operations/logistics and CARVYKTI® order management systems.
  </li>
  <li>
   Data analysis and insight gathering. Via both personal, onsite observations, as well as reviews of system-generated data, you’ll proactively advise the treatment facility on opportunities to improve their utilization of, and efficiency around, the CARVYKTI® therapy.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  About You
 </p>
 <p>
  You are customer-focused and passionate about delivering a great support experience that your customers will remember and want to tell other people about. You welcome the challenge of working in a highly visible role where you can meaningfully impact the health and wellbeing of others. You are a motivated self-starter and quick study who approaches assignments with vitality and diligence.

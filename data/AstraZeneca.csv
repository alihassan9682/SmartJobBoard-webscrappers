   AstraZeneca

  we turn ideas into life changing medicines. Working here means being entrepreneurial, thinking big and working together to make the impossible a reality. We’re focused on the potential of science to address the unmet needs of patients around the world. We commit to those areas where we think we can really change the course of medicine and bring big new ideas to life. As a

 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  AstraZeneca's strategy in
  <b>
   CVRM
  </b>
  is a patient-centric approach to disease treatment, so we are tackling multiple risk factors by uniting our cardiovascular (CV), metabolic and chronic kidney disease (CKD) areas into one integrated approach – cardiovascular renal metabolic (CVRM).  This approach means we look at the CVMD patient as a whole, rather than by disease area, because we know that cardiovascular disease is a well-known consequence of diabetes and CKD.  Each of ours focus areas seek to further reduce morbidity, mortality and organ damage by addressing multiple risk factors across cardiovascular (CV) disease, diabetes and chronic kidney-disease indications. The patient-centric approach is reinforced by science-led life-cycle management programs and technologies, including early research into regenerative methods.

 </p>
 <p>
  AstraZeneca's strategy in
  <b>
   CVRM
  </b>
  is a patient-centric approach to disease treatment, so we are tackling multiple risk factors by uniting our cardiovascular (CV), metabolic and chronic kidney disease (CKD) areas into one integrated approach – cardiovascular renal metabolic (CVRM).  This approach means we look at the CVMD patient as a whole, rather than by disease area, because we know that cardiovascular disease is a well-known consequence of diabetes and CKD.  Each of ours focus areas seek to further reduce morbidity, mortality and organ damage by addressing multiple risk factors across cardiovascular (CV) disease, diabetes and chronic kidney-disease indications. The patient-centric approach is reinforced by science-led life-cycle management programs and technologies, including early research into regenerative methods.

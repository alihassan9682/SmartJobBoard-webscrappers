  The Marketing Analytics and Business Insights (MABI) team supporting AbbVie’s US Commercial organization is 200+ members strong and growing every day. We comprise highly respected researchers, analysts, and strategists striving to be the gold standard Research &amp; Analytics organization within the biopharmaceutical industry. We serve as strategic in-house advisor and pragmatic compass to Marketing, Sales, and Leadership – ensuring that all decisions are grounded in rigorous intelligence and earned intuition. We look at ‘data’ differently – as an input into insight generation, not an endgame. We appreciate ambiguity but recognize the need for clarity. We work tirelessly to build new capabilities and skill sets, encouraging our team members to pull up a chair, be themselves, be creative, speak their minds, and do good work. Patients depend on us, and we take that very seriously – without taking ourselves too seriously. We are smart, fun, quirky, and innovative – and we’d love for you to join us.
 </p>

Secondly, you will contribute to the development of cutting-edge BI reporting and analytics capabilities, enabling our organization to derive actionable insights and drive informed decision-making.
